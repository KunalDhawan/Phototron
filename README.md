# The Kick Ball Theory- Autonomous Football Playing Bot
Made an Intelligent Robot which can shoot the ball into the Goal Post of other Player using concepts of Computer Vision. Used Raspberry Pi to operate the bot(wirelessly) and OpenCV for processing the Video input. The implemented Code helps the bot to detect the ball in the environment, move towards it (2-D motion), align in correct position and score a goal in presence of opponent team bot, doing all this in real time.
