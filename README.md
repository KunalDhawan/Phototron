# Phototron-Autonomous Ball Catching Bot

The aim of this project was to autonomously catch a ball falling down from an inclined plane having obstacles.The concepts used were : Tracking the position of ball and finding obstacles using Image processing , doing a linear curve fitting for approximate motion of ball using Linear regression, sending data to bot for autonomous movement using subscribers and publishers in ROS(Robot operating system). This project stood first in the competition at Techniche 2016 , the Annual Technical fest of IIT Guwahati.
